To contribute to development, you will need to download and install the required software first.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Visual Studio 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/vs/whatsnew/) - We are using C# 7.0 code so VS 2017 is required to compile.  VS 2015 or older will not be able to compile the code.

### `Cloning Source Code`

Next, you need to get the source code.  This source code repository uses git submodules. So when you clone the source code, you will need to clone recursively:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheUnnamedOrganisation/RocketBot.git
```

Or if you already cloned without the recursive option, you can update the submodules by running:

```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/TheUnnamedOrganisation/RocketBot.git
cd RocketBot
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
